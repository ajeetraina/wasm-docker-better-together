# ðŸ‘‰ WebAssembly and Docker - Better Together

Docker Community sees Wasm as a complementary technology to Linux containers. This is where developers can choose which technology they use (or both!) depending on the use case. And as the community explores whatâ€™s possible with Wasm, the effort is to make Wasm applications easier to develop, build, and run using the experience and tools you know and love.
